# sycamore-test

For the Sycamore frontend assessment, I have created a customer dashboard using Vue.js, Pinia for state management, and Tailwind CSS.

## features

- The dashboard is capable of CRUD operations on data with the following schema - first name, last name, email, phone number, state, status, details.
- I created a custom vue directive, `v-validate-form-input`, to validate all data fields.
- The customer list first name, last name, email, phone number, state and status.
- I used Pinia to store customer data.
- It is responsive across all screen sizes.
- It is aesthetically pleasing (I made up the design as I went, drawing inspiration from previous experiences working on dashboards.)
